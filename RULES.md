**-****-****Halloween Hack-a-thon****-****-**
1. Create 3 different hero classes that inherit the abstract hero class. The classes are:
    Attack type: High attack and low to mid shield and health. 
    Shield type: High shield and low to mid attack and health. 
    Health type: High health and low to mid attack and shield.

2. Health and shield both prevent player from dying upon being hit. Devise different behaviour for the two. Does health regenerate? Does shield give player a chance to block an attack entirely? Is the shield always up? Needs to be raised? Use your imagination.

3. Make a special attack method for the hero classes that inflict more damage to enemies when used, but they can only be used 3 times per fight.

4. Player must choose which type of hero they will play upon loading the game.

5. Create at least 4 different spooky themed enemies that inherit the abstract enemy class.

6. Implement at least 1 interface.

7. Create a text based narrative around the player going through a haunted house and clearing out all the spooky enemies.

8. Have at least 10 enemies in the haunted house.

9. Have the player make choices about situations they encounter. i.e. if an enemy attacks then give them options to: run away, attack, or use special move. i.e Have them choose on where to go in the haunted house.
